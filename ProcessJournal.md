## 10-8-2019 - Making the first records of this project
- - - - 
This is where I'll be keeping a record of all the conceptual and technical work for my tentatively titled Toast Game, and where it will remain for posterity as reference for future generations to marvel at the genius of some rando's senior year Game Engine Scripting midterm project.  
So, the requirements for this project atm are a little sparse. All that's due on the 14th is a filled-out version of a basic design document and a prototype Unity project that isn't empty. And I've got both those things! For the first chunk of this entry, I'm going to copy in some of my text from the design doc. It is of course subject to change, and in the case that I make any life-altering edits I'll record them in the subsequent journal entry.

> **Mantra or Tagline:** A single-sentence description of the game that you will use to guide design decisions

> "A point-and-shoot game where you launch toast out of a toaster."

> **Design Pillars:** Up to three words or phrases that convey the feeling or emotion that you want the player to experience

> "Cute, silly, fun."

> **Story or Gameplay Summary:** List what the game is from a gameplay and/or story perspective

> "This game has the player aim a toaster on a rotating axis and launch toast onto targets."

> **Feature List:** List all of the features that you want to include in your game

> * Spinning toaster player
> * Launcing toast from toaster
> * Targets to aim toast at
> * 3D environment
> * Sound effects for all actions
> * Ambient soundtrack
> * Timer that counts down
> * UI that tracks points 

> **References:** Link to at least three other pieces of media that have something similar to whar you are trying to accomplish and explain which element you are interested in

> * [I am Bread](http://www.iambreadgame.com/): Absurdist game centering around toast, set in a mundane environment. Differences are that the player is the bread instead of the toaster, and the gameplay is movement instead of aiming and firing.

> **Target Audience and Platform:** Who is the target audience for the game? How do they play it?

> The game will be a simple PC mouse-and-keyboard game, and the audience is other developers who enjoy mechanically simple cute, free games on itch.io.

> **Asset Research:** Look through free resources to find assets you are considering for your project.
